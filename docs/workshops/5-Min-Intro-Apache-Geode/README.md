●	Introduce simple slide that will focus the viewer's attention.
   - Introduction 
○	Look at how the authors in the example courses above begin a video in their course; not the introduction to the course, but the individual videos within the course.
o	Assume your audience already has the background skills necessary to follow your lead in the video. Don’t give the history of the subject—state what you’re going to do and then just jump right in. You only have 5 minutes, so keep it as simple as “Let’s take a look at the security settings related to Azure AD” or “Now that we have a highly available RDS instance created, let's see what happens when we cause it to failover.”
●	Teach us something
○	Spend 4-5 minutes teaching how to accomplish a task. Sticking to this length is important—it’s the average length of individual videos within our courses, so it’s important for us to see that you’re able to teach something in this timeframe.
○	Teach something from the middle of a course, not an intro; really get into something specific. Think of this like a book’s Table of Contents—don’t do a video of the Introduction or even Chapter 1. Do a demo of something that might appear after you’re a few chapters in.
○	About slides.
○	If your video includes slides, make some kind of change to the screen every 20-30 seconds (a new bullet point, the next step in a graphic, etc.).
○	Don’t create slides that are text heavy; slides should be either short bullets or a graphic. Full instruction will come through what you’re saying and viewers shouldn’t get distracted by reading paragraphs of info.
○	Don’t just click through a series of steps. Explain why you make certain choices or changes. Explain why it matters that you do something in a certain way. Help your viewers understand the expertise and reasoning behind your actions. As the SME on a topic, it’s valuable to learners to hear your experiences and get your guidance (e.g., “It’s been my experience that…” or “I’ve often found that…”)
○	Watch your mouse activity. If you’re going to select something, don’t jiggle your mouse over it and say “click here.” Maintain steady mouse movement and say what you’re selecting.
●	Organize your content
○	Know what you’re going to say, but don’t read off of a sheet. Your video should sound like you’re having a conversation with someone who’s sitting next to you.
○	Watch your pacing and your tone. Don’t speak so quickly that viewers have trouble following along. Keep your tone conversational and not monotone. Your tone should keep viewers engaged.
●	Conclude your video very briefly. Don’t do a full rundown of what viewers just learned. One sentence is plenty. Also, don’t spend time going into detail about what viewers will learn next. This video needs to focus on this video—not what’s to come.
