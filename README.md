Building Faster Cloud-Native Applications at Scale with Tanzu GemFire (Back to top)

Instructors: Wayne Lund, Gregory Green, Charlie Black

Brief: Tanzu GemFire enables fast access to application data with strong consistency and high availability. Learn more about Spring Data and Spring Boot abstractions, and Tanzu Gemfire in this workshop.

Abstract:
This workshop explores the use of Tanzu GemFire for fast access to application data with strong consistency and high availability. Youâ€™ll walk away from this interactive, hands-on session with a better understanding of:

1 - How developers can use the Tanzu GemFire Operator to quickly instantiate GemFire
2 - How availability of data can be maintained in light of node/pod failures and or whole site failures.
3 - How to take advantage of Tanzu GemFire availability build resilience into your applications
4 - How to build, run, and test your applications at scale
-  Usage of Spring Data and Spring Boot abstractions for Tanzu GemFire
How developers can configure applications to enable Tanzu GemFire for caching based on design patterns widely used in Cloud-Native Applications
How to configure GemFire persistence for High Availability and Fault Tolerant
How to setup multiple WAN replication clusters for active-active for active passive GemFire clusters
